            <p>"I started training sessions with Chris Wheeler after a referral from a friend. I recently suffered a serious injury from hang gliding and I needed a trainer to help restore muscle strength and endurance. Chris set me up on an individually tailored program that took my injury into consideration and worked to establish pre injury muscle strength. Unbelievable-this trainer knows the subtle details of each piece of equipment and exercise to maximize my recovery. His knowledge of the relationship between training, nutrition and motivation is exceptional. Thanks Chris!."</p>
